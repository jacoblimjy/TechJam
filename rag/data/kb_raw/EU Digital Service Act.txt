## Digital Services Act

The Digital  Services  Act [1] ( DSA )  is  an  EU regulation adopted in 2022 that addresses illegal content, transparent advertising and disinformation. It updates the Electronic Commerce  Directive  2000  in  EU  law, [2][3] and was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The DSA applies to online platforms and intermediaries such as social networks, marketplaces, pornographic platforms, [4] and app stores. [5] Key requirements include disclosing  to  regulators  how  their  algorithms work, providing users with explanations for content moderation decisions, and implementing stricter controls on targeted advertising.  It  also  imposes  specific  rules  on "very large" online platforms and search engines (those  having  more  than  45  million  monthly active users in the EU). [6]

## Objectives

Ursula  von  der  Leyen  proposed  a  "new  Digital Services  Act"  in  her  2019  bid  for  the  European Commission's presidency. [7]

The expressed purpose of the DSA was to update the European Union's legal framework for illegal content on intermediaries, in particular by modernising the e-Commerce Directive that had been adopted in 2000. In doing so, the DSA aimed to harmonise different national laws in the European Union that have emerged to address illegal content at national level. [2] Most prominent amongst these laws was the German NetzDG, and similar laws in Austria ("KommunikationsplattformenGesetz") and France ("Loi Avia"). With the adoption of the Digital Services Act at European level, those national laws were planned to be overridden and would have to be amended. [8]

In  practice,  this  would  lead  to  new  legislation  regarding  illegal  content,  transparent  advertising and disinformation. [3]

## New obligations on platform companies
The  DSA  is  meant  to  "govern  the  content  moderation  practices  of  social  media  platforms"  and address  illegal  content. [9] It  is  organised  in  five  chapters,  with  the  most  important  chapters regulating the liability exemption of intermediaries (Chapter 2), the obligations on intermediaries (Chapter  3),  and  the  cooperation  and  enforcement  framework  between  the  commission  and national authorities (Chapter 4).

The DSA proposal maintains the current rule according to which companies that host others' data become  liable  when  informed  that  this  data  is  illegal. [9] This  so-called  "conditional  liability exemption" is fundamentally different [10][11] from  the  broad  immunities  given  to  intermediaries under the equivalent rule ("Section 230 CDA") in the United States.

The DSA applies to intermediary service providers that offer their services to users based in the European Union, irrespective of whether the intermediary service provider is established in the European Union. [12]

In  addition  to  the  liability  exemptions,  the  DSA  would  introduce  a  wide-ranging  set  of  new obligations on platforms, including some that aim to disclose to regulators how their algorithms work, while other obligations would create transparency on how decisions to remove content are taken and on the way advertisers target users. The European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency was created to aid the enforcement of this. [13]

A December 2020 Time article said that while many of its provisions only apply to platforms which have more than 45 million users in the European Union, the Act could have repercussions beyond Europe. Platforms including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Google's subsidiary YouTube would meet that threshold and be subjected to the new obligations. [14]

A 16 November 2021 Internet Policy Review listed some of new obligations including mandatory "notice-and-action" requirements, for example, respect fundamental rights, mandatory redress for content removal decisions, and a comprehensive risk management and audit framework. [15]

Companies  that  do  not  comply  with  the  new  obligations  risk  fines  of  up  to  6%  on  their  global annual turnover. In addition, the Commission can apply periodic penalties up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover for each day of delay in complying with remedies, interim measures, and commitments. As a last resort measure, if the infringement persists and causes serious harm to users and entails criminal offences involving threat to persons' life or safety, the Commission can request the temporary suspension of the service. [16]

## Large online platforms
On 23 April 2023, the European Commission named a first list of 19 online platforms that will be required  to  comply  starting  25  August  2023. [17] They  include  the  following  very  large  online platforms (VLOPs) with more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU as of 17 February 2023. [18]

Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs):
- Bing
- Google Search

Amazon and Zalando both initiated proceedings in the General Court challenging the designations, claiming unequal treatment compared to other large retailers, and that their core business models are retail not distributing third party content/products. Zalando  argued  the criteria and methodology  lack  transparency,  for  instance  in  how  it  counts  active  users,  while  Amazon  said VLOP  rules  are  disproportionate  for  its  business  model  and  asked  to  be  exempted  from transparency around targeted ads. [19][20]

As of December 2023, 13 VLOPs have received a request for information (RFI), [16] the procedure necessary to verify compliance with the DSA, and one is being subjected to a formal proceedings. [21] 3  further  platforms,  all  of  them  providing  adult  content,  were  added  on  20 December 2023. [22]

## Legislative history

The European Commission submitted the DSA alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to the European Parliament and the Council on 15 December 2020. [5][23] The DSA was prepared by von der Leyen Commission members Margrethe Vestager (Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age) and Thierry Breton (European Commissioner for Internal Market). [24]

The Digital Services Act builds in large parts on the non-binding Commission Recommendation 2018/314  of  1  March  2018 [25] when  it  comes  to  illegal  content  on  platforms.  However,  it  goes further in addressing topics such as disinformation and other risks especially on very large online platforms.  As  part  of  the  preparatory  phase,  the  European  Commission  launched  a  public consultation  on  the  package  to  gather  evidence  between  July  and  September  2020. [26][27] An impact assessment was published alongside the proposal on 15 December 2020 with the relevant evidence base. [28]

The European Parliament appointed Danish Social Democrat Christel Schaldemose as rapporteur for the Digital Services Act. On 20 January 2022 the Parliament voted to introduce amendments in the DSA for tracking-free advertising and a ban on using a minor's data for targeted ads, as well as a  new  right  for  users  to  seek  compensation  for  damages. [29] In  the  wake  of  the  Facebook  Files revelations and a hearing by Facebook  Whistleblower Frances Haugen  in the European Parliament, [30] the  European  Parliament  also  strengthened  the  rules  on  fighting  disinformation and harmful content, as well as tougher auditing requirements. [31]

The  Council  of  the  European  Union  adopted  its  position  on  25  November  2021. [32] The  most significant  changes  introduced  by  the  Member  States  are  to  entrust  the  European  Commission with the enforcement of the new rules, in the wake of allegations and complaints that the Irish Data  Protection  Watchdog  was  not  effectively  policing  the  bloc's  data  protection  rules  against platform companies. [33]

The Data Governance Act (DGA) was formally approved by the European Parliament on 6 April 2022. [34] This  sets  up  a  legal  framework for common data spaces in Europe which will increase data sharing in sectors such as finance, health, and the environment. [34][35]

With  Russia  using  social  media  platforms  to  spread  misinformation  about  the  2022  Russian invasion of Ukraine, European policymakers felt a greater sense of urgency to move the legislation forward to ensure that major tech platforms were transparent and properly regulated, according to The Washington Post . [36] On 22 April 2022, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament  reached  a  deal  on  the  Digital  Services  Act  in  Brussels  following  sixteen  hours  of negotiations. [37][38][39] According  to The  Washington  Post ,  the  agreement  reached  in  Brussels solidifies the two-bill plan- the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, a law regulating competition.  The  latter  is  aimed  at  preventing  abuse  of  power  against  smaller  competitors  by larger "gatekeepers". [36]

On 5 July 2022, the European Parliament approved both the DSA and the DMA. [40] Following this, on  4  October  2022,  the  European  Council  gave  its  final  approval  to  the  DSA. [41] The  DSA  was adopted on 19 October 2022 and was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27  October  2022. [1] It  came  into  force  on  16  November  2022. [42] Most  services  were  given  15 months to comply with its provisions (until 17 February 2024 [43] ).  However, "very large" online platforms  and  search  engines,  after  their  designation  as  such,  had  only  four  months  to  comply (until 23 August 2023). [40]

## Influence of the European Court of Human Rights

The DSA was passed alongside the Digital Markets Act and the Democracy Action Plan. [44] The latter of these is focused on addressing the nuanced legal interpretation of free speech on digital platforms, a fundamental right that has been extensively guided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the European Convention on Human Rights. [45] Accordingly, the Democracy

Action Plan, and subsequently the DSA, were strongly influenced by the Delfi AS v. Estonia and Magyar  Tartalomszolgáltatók  Egyesülete  and  Index.hu  Zrt  v.  Hungary ECtHR  cases,  which outlined a framework for assessing intermediary liability on digital platforms. [46]

In Delfi AS v. Estonia , the ECtHR applied proportionality analysis when considering whether the Estonian courts' decision to hold the online platform Delfi liable for hate speech posted by its users was a proportionate restriction on Delfi's right to freedom of expression. [47] The court found that, given the serious nature of the hate speech, the Estonian courts' actions were justified to protect the rights of others. [48] In other words, the ECtHR upheld the liability of online platforms for hate speech posted by their users, underlining that platforms could be expected to take proactive steps to  control  content  when  there  is  a  clear  risk  of  harm  from  unlawful  comments.  This  case highlighted the responsibilities of platforms to prevent the spread of harmful content. [47]

On  the  other  hand,  the MTE  and  Index.hu  v.  Hungary case  illustrated  the  nuanced  limits  of freedom of speech on digital platforms. [49] In its application of proportionality analysis, the ECtHR found that the Hungarian courts had failed to strike a fair balance between protecting reputation and  ensuring  freedom  of  expression. [50] The  Hungarian  courts  imposed  strict  liability  on  the platforms for user comments that were offensive but did not constitute hate speech, constituting a disproportionate interference in the platforms' right to freedom of expression. The ECtHR ruled that imposing strict liability on platforms for user comments, without consideration of the nature of the comments or the context in which they were made, could infringe on freedom of expression. This judgment emphasized the need for a balance between protecting reputation and upholding free speech on digital platforms. [49]

These decisions by the ECtHR provided critical legal precedents that shaped the EU's decisionmaking  process  on  the  framework  of  the  DSA.  In  particular,  the  DSA  drew  from  the  ECtHR's distinction between different types of illegal content, as well as its proportionality analysis in both cases, by incorporating nuanced rules on intermediary liability and ensuring that measures taken by platforms do not unreasonably restrict users' freedom of expression and information. [51]

## Reactions

Media reactions to the Digital Services Act have been mixed. In January 2022, the editorial board of The Washington Post stated that the U.S. could learn from these rules, [52] while whistleblower Frances  Haugen  stated  that  it  could  set  a  "gold  standard"  of  regulation  worldwide. [53] Tech journalist Casey Newton has argued that the DSA will shape US tech policy. [54] Mike Masnick of Techdirt  praised  the  DSA  for  ensuring  the  right  to  pay  for  digital  services  anonymously,  but criticised  the  act  for  not  including  provisions  that  would  have  required  a  court  order  for  the removal of illegal content. [55]

Scholars  have  begun  critically  examining  the  Digital  Services  Act. [56][57] Some  academics  have expressed concerns that the Digital Services Act might be too rigid and prescribed, [58] excessively focused on individual content decisions or vague risk assessments. [59]

Civil Society organisations such as Electronic Frontier Foundation have called for stronger privacy protections. [60] Human Rights Watch has welcomed the transparency and user remedies but called for  an  end  to  abusive  surveillance  and  profiling. [61] Amnesty  International  has  welcomed  many aspects  of  the  proposal  in  terms  of  fundamental  rights  balance,  but  also  asked  for  further restrictions on advertising. [62] Advocacy organisation Avaaz has compared the Digital Services Act to the Paris Agreement for climate change. [63]

Following  the  2023  Hamas-led  attack  on  Israel,  Thierry  Breton  wrote  public  letters  to  X,  Meta Platforms, TikTok, and YouTube on how their platforms complied with the DSA regarding content related  to  the  conflict  and  upcoming  elections.  The  Atlantic  Council's  Digital  Forensic  Research Lab reported that Breton's letters did not follow DSA processes, and digital rights group Access Now  criticised  Breton's  letters  for  drawing  a  "false  equivalence"  between  illegal  content  and disinformation. [64]

Tech companies have repeatedly criticised the heavy burden of the rules and the alleged lack of clarity of the Digital Services Act, [65] and have been accused of lobbying to undermine some of the more  far-reaching  demands  by  law-makers,  notably  on  bans  for  targeted  advertising, [66] and  a high-profile apology from Sundar Pichai to Breton on leaked plans by Google to lobby against the Digital Services Act. [67]

A bipartisan group of US senators have called the DSA and DMA discriminatory, claiming that the legislation  would  "focus  on  regulations  on  a  handful  of  American  companies  while  failing  to regulate similar companies based in Europe, China, Russia and elsewhere." [68][69]

The DSA was mostly welcomed by the European media sector. [70] Due to the influence gatekeepers have in selecting and controlling the visibility of certain journalistic articles over others through their  online  platforms,  the  European  Federation  of  Journalists  encouraged  EU  legislators  to further increase the transparency of platforms' recommendation systems via the DSA. [71]

Nevertheless,  the  DSA's  later  stage  inter-institutional  negotiations,  or  trilogues,  have  been criticized  as  lacking  transparency  and  equitable  participation. [72] These  criticisms  mirror  past experiences with the drafting of the EU Regulation on Preventing the Dissemination of Terrorist Content Online as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). [73]

Swedish  member  of  the  European  Parliament  Jessica  Stegrud  argued  that  the  DSA's  focus  on preventing  the  spread  of  disinformation  and  "harmful  content"  would  undermine  freedom  of speech. [74]

After  the  first  round  of  the  2024  Romanian  presidential  election  was  invalidated  due  to  reports allegedly  showing  Russian  involvement  on  TikTok  in  favor  of  Călin  Georgescu,  an  investigation was conducted to determine whether TikTok had breached the DSA. [75]

## Impacts

## Feature and content removal

In  August  2024,  TikTok  agreed  to  withdraw  its  TikTok  Lite  rewards  feature  after  it  was investigated under the DSA  due to concerns about its "addictive effect", especially for children. [76][77]

A 2024 study of deleted Facebook and YouTube comments by the Future of Free Speech think tank at  Vanderbilt  University  suggested  that  "platforms,  pages,  or  channels  may  be  over-removing content to avoid regulatory penalties" under the DSA. [78]

## Outside the EU

The Washington Post wrote in 2023 that tech companies may apply features instituted to comply with the DSA to countries outside of the EU, and that researchers have argued that the DSA could provide a framework for the United States to impose stricter regulations on tech companies. [79] The Economist wrote in 2023 that the Brussels effect, whereby social media platforms implement EU regulations globally to save costs, "is far from guaranteed" with the DSA due to tech companies being unwilling to "[lose] sovereignty over their digital territories everywhere". [80]

Among legal academics, Dawn Nunziato of the George Washington University argued in 2022 that the  DSA  "will  further  instantiate  the  Brussels  Effect,  whereby  EU  regulators  wield  powerful influence  on  how  social  media  platforms  moderate  content  on  the  global  scale". [81] Suzanne Vergnolle of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers stated her belief in 2023 that the DSA would have a Brussels effect, similar to that of the General Data Protection Regulation, but that "it's  going  to  take  years". [82] Martin  Husovec  of  the  London  School  of  Economics  and  Jennifer Urban of the University of California, Berkeley wrote in 2024 that "the chances of spontaneous voluntary  implementation  beyond  the  EU's  borders  for  four  key  parts  of  the  DSA  -  content moderation procedures, transparency and governance obligations, and risk management rules seem modest." [83]

## Similar legislation

The 2023 Brazilian Fake News Bill, a proposed new social media regulation framework introduced in the National Congress, heavily referenced the DSA and contained similar provisions. [84][85]
